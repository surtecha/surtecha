I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science, driven by a deep passion for harnessing the potential of **Machine Learning** to address diverse interdisciplinary challenges. Additionally, I am actively engaged in academic research at my university and have already achieved the milestone of publishing a research paper. Beyond my Machine Learning projects, I am equally enthusiastic about competitive programming. 

I take pride in my role as an avid open-source contributor and a staunch advocate for free software.
